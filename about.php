						<p>We've walked many miles in your shoes and seen it all. As licensed insurance agents located in Phoenix, Arizona, we originally designed our program to overcome the DO NOT CALL and Caller ID legislation, which made it difficult for insurance agents to market via the telephone.</p>

						<p>But because the success of our strategic program was so significant, we were able to leapfrog to the number 2 producing property/casualty agency from a field of 15,000 agents at one of the big Top 3 insurance carriers. We also started to get requests about the secrets of our soaring success from other insurance agents all over the country. As a result of this huge demand, we started Only Insurance Leads. Now, we've been in business for more than 10 years and have mailed more than 20 million customized quotes for insurance agencies nationwide. And the demand continues because our program works.</p>
